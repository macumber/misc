   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=SURFACE 12
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** CalcSurfaceCentroid: 16 Surfaces have the Z coordinate < 0.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Wind Speed will be 0.0 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...in any calculations, Outside temperatures will be the outside temperature + 9.750E-003 for these surfaces.
   **   ~~~   ** ...that is, these surfaces will have conditions as though at ground level.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 4 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Severe  ** Sizing: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed "1 SPD DX CLG COIL": Rated air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling capacity is out of range.

   ************* Beginning Simulation
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed="1 SPD DX CLG COIL" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling capacity is out of range at 1.782E-004 m3/s/W.
   **   ~~~   **  Environment=DENVER CENTENNIAL  GOLDEN   N ANN CLG .4% CONDNS DB=>MWB, at Simulation time=07/21 08:10 - 08:20
   **   ~~~   ** Expected range for VolumeFlowPerRatedTotalCapacity=[2.684E-005--6.713E-005]
   **   ~~~   ** Possible causes include inconsistent air flow rates in system components,
   **   ~~~   ** or variable air volume [VAV] system using incorrect coil type.
